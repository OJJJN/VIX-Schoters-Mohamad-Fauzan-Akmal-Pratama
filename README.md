As part of a virtual internship program with Rakamin Academy, I have been learning to be a Mobile Apps Developer at Schoters for one month. My final task at the company was to create an newss app that displays class data from a cloud database using an API, which is then consumed using the Retrofit library and displayed using a RecyclerView.
